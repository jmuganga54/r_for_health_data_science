# R for Health Data Science

> Learning health data science with R

This project contains **R scripts** designed to support learning the basics of health data science with R.

It introduces essential commands and workflows for data management and analysis, with a focus on applications in **health data science**. The content is inspired by the Statistics Team at the University of Manchester’s *Introduction to R for Health Data Science*.   

The repository is free for public use and open to contributions from anyone interested in improving or expanding the materials.

## Goals

- Get started with R and become familiar with its environment  
- Learn about core **data structures** in R  
- Practice handling and transforming data using the **Tidyverse**  
- Import, export, and manage data efficiently in R  
- Use **control structures** (loops and conditions) to write flexible code  
- Create and document your own **functions**  
- Apply good practices for **projects and reproducibility**  
- Explore data visualization, from basic plotting to **ggplot2**  
- Develop a consistent **programming style** and prepare for advanced topics  

## Structure

Inside the `/public` folder, you will find organized subfolders for each chapter.  
Each chapter contains:  

- **Scripts** – R scripts with data management and analysis examples  
- **Data** – Practice datasets to support hands-on learning  

Example structure:  
```
/public
├── chapter1/
│ ├── scripts/
│ └── data/
├── chapter2/
│ ├── scripts/
│ └── data/
└── ...
```
