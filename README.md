# R for Health Data Science

> Learning health data science with R

This project contains **R scripts** designed to support learning the basics of health data science with R.

It introduces essential commands and workflows for data manipulation and analysis, with a focus on applications in **health data science**. The content is inspired by the Statistics Team at the University of Manchester’s `Introduction to R for Health Data Science`.   

The repository is free for public use and open to contributions from anyone interested in improving or expanding the materials.

## Goals

* Get you ‘up and running’ using `R` and `RStudio` on your machine.
* Introduce the basics of programming in R (a key skill for a health data scientist).
* Introduce good practices of workflows and reproducibility in data science.
* Enable you to develop your skills independently in programming and data science workflow.

## Structure  

You will see each chapter or section organized in its own folder.  
Within each folder, you may find:  

- **Scripts** – R scripts with data manipulation and analysis examples  
- **Data** – Practice datasets to support hands-on learning (if applicable)  

Example:  

```
chapter1/
├── scripts/
└── data/
chapter2/
├── scripts/
└── data/
```
