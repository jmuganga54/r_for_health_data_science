### 1.1 Course objectives

### 1.2 Course description

R is statistical software which is open source and free. 

R also supports and interacts with tools for documenting your code, making it efficient and reproducible.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>While some parts of the course can be read, we encourage you to have your own RStudio open, to replicate the steps being described. 
There are exercises interspersed throughout the course.

### 1.3 How the Course Will Run

This is a self-study module that should take between 20 and 40 hours to complete.


### 1.4 Accessibility


### 1.5 Resources

Note that none of these are essential reading, we include them here for information. 
We will make specific reference to parts of these resources throughout the course.

#### Online Resources

[Adventures in R](https://www.adventures-in-r.com/) – A fantastic free resource - highly recommended if you want to take a deeper dive than this course does.

[R Bootcamp](https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/) – Another great resource with interactive exercises.

[Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) – Includes interactive R tutorials. Some free material, but you will have to pay for full access.

#### Books

* If you have time to read one book, we would recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). We will refer to specific Chapters of this book in this course, but do feel free to read the rest!

* An excellent, slightly more basic text is [Hands on Programming in R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/). Freely available online, and recommended as an alternative source if you struggle to get to grips with what is presented here.

* A further text that we will make reference to is [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)

* [RMarkdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) provides further reading on RMarkdown. Freely available online.

* The Art of R Programming another favourite of ours](https://diytranscriptomics.com/Reading/files/The%20Art%20of%20R%20Programming.pdf). Freely available in pdf.

* [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/). This book is more focused on statistics - so a useful companion for later courses too.

### Other Resources

* [Rstudio](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) provides a page with further resources.

* [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) is a good start point when you want to search for R packages for specific statistical challenges.

* If you have burning questions, searching on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is also a good option. Type in any search engine with “description of your question R: stackoverflow”. For example, “how to calculate mean in R: stackoverflow”

* [Tidy Tuesdays](https://www.tidytuesday.com/). This is a weekly project aimed at tidyverse users. Each week a new data file and associated article or chart are uploaded. Your task is to try and write R code to reproduce the figure or analysis in the article. The resources are found on github:[tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
