## 🧭 Session 10: Plotting with ggplot2

## 🎯 Overview
In this session, we will learn how to **create beautiful, flexible, and professional data visualisations** in R using the **ggplot2** package — one of the most powerful tools in the tidyverse for data visualization.

## 🧩 10.1 ggplot2 – Creating Plots in the Tidyverse Way

### What We’ll Learn
- Understand what **ggplot2** is and why it’s preferred over base R plots.  
- Learn the **Grammar of Graphics** — the logic behind how ggplot2 builds plots step-by-step.  
- Build plots using **layers**, including:
  - **Data:** the dataset you want to visualise.  
  - **Aesthetics (aes):** how data variables map to plot features like x, y, color, and size.  
  - **Geometries (geom):** the type of plot (points, lines, bars, etc.).  
- Practice creating common plots such as:
  - **Histograms** (to show distributions)  
  - **Scatter plots** (to show relationships between two variables)  
  - **Boxplots** (to compare groups)  
- Learn how to **customize your plots** with labels, titles, colours, and themes.

📘 **Reference:** Chapter 10 of *R for Data Science* (skip section 10.7).



## 🔍 10.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### What We’ll Learn
Now that we can visualise data, we’ll use our plotting skills to **explore and understand data patterns**.

We will:  
- Use **visual tools** to look for **patterns, trends, and outliers** in data.  
- Compare variables and identify **relationships or correlations**.  
- Learn to **spot unusual observations** or errors in data.  
- Understand how visualization supports **data-driven decision-making**.

📘 **Reference:** Sections 11.1–11.4 of Chapter 11 (*R for Data Science*).

## 📚 10.3 Further Reading

For more hands-on practice:  
- Try the **Data Visualisation workshop** from *Andrew Stewart’s course*.  
  This workshop covers advanced plotting techniques and communication tips to make your visualizations clearer and more impactful.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, we will be able to:
- Create professional-quality visualisations using **ggplot2**.  
- Combine **data, aesthetics, and geometry** layers to build flexible plots.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using ggplot2.  
- Customize plots to make them clear, informative, and visually appealing.
