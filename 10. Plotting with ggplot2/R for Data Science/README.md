# 🎨 Visualize — Data Exploration and Communication with ggplot2

## 🧭 Overview

After learning the basics of R and data manipulation, this section dives deeper into **data visualization** — the art of exploring, understanding, and communicating data using clear and effective graphics.

Visualization is often the **first step in data exploration**, helping us *see* patterns, trends, and issues before diving into complex analysis.

## 🧱 Chapter 9: Layers — The Grammar of Graphics

In this chapter, we’ll learn how **ggplot2** builds plots step-by-step using the **Grammar of Graphics**.  
Each plot is built by layering components together.

### 🧩 Main Components of a ggplot:

1. **Data** – The dataset you want to visualize.  
2. **Aesthetics (`aes()`)** – Define how variables map to visual properties like x, y, color, or size.  
3. **Geoms (`geom_*()`)** – The geometric shape of the plot, e.g., `geom_point()` for scatter plots or `geom_bar()` for bar charts.

You can also add layers for titles, themes, and trend lines.

## 🔍 Chapter 10: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** helps us understand data through visualization and transformation.  
It’s an **iterative process** where we:
1. Ask questions about the data.  
2. Visualize, transform, and model to find answers.  
3. Use what we learn to ask new, better questions.

EDA is more about *curiosity* than strict rules. We freely explore ideas, identify patterns, and refine our understanding.

### 🧠 Common EDA Questions:
- What kind of **variation** exists within a variable?  
- What kind of **covariation** (relationships) exists between variables?

📘 We use the **tidyverse**, especially `ggplot2` and `dplyr`, to interactively explore data.

## 💬 Chapter 11: Communication — Sharing Your Findings

Once we understand our data, we must communicate it clearly to others.  
Exploratory plots help *us* think; **explanatory plots** help *others* understand.

### 🏷️ Make Your Plots Clear
Use the **`labs()`** function to add descriptive titles, subtitles, captions, and axis labels.

Example:
```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Car type",
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception due to light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
```

You can also add mathematical symbols in axis labels using `quote()` and customize themes for better readability.

### 🧰 Useful Packages
- **`ggplot2`** – Create the visualizations.  
- **`scales`** – Adjust colors, breaks, and transformations.  
- **`ggrepel`** – Prevent overlapping text labels.  
- **`patchwork`** – Combine multiple plots.
